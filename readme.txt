The AddThis Social Bookmarking Widget allows any visitor to bookmark and share your site easily with many popular services. 

== Description ==
Help your visitor promote your site! The AddThis Social Bookmarking Widget allows your users to bookmark your site easily with over 45 popular services, and to share it with friends via email. Our button is small, unobtrusive, quick to load and recognized all over the web.

Sign up for an AddThis.com account to see how your visitors are sharing your content: which services they're using for sharing, which content is shared the most, and more. It's all free--even the pretty charts and graphs.

Over 120,000 sites have installed AddThis. Join us!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `addthis_social_widget.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. (Optional) Customize the plugin in the Settings > AddThis menu

Note: due to the confusion for many of our users, there are no longer separate versions for PHP4 and PHP5.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is AddThis free? =

Yep! The features you see today on AddThis will always be free. 

= Do I need to create an account? =

No. You only need to create an account if you want to see how your users are sharing your blog; the sharing itself works the same either way.

= Is JavaScript required? =

If you've turned on the drop-down menu (which is recommended, as it's been shown to increase sharing/bookmarking rates), JavaScript must be enabled. We load the actual interface via JavaScript at run-time, which allows us to upgrade the core functionality of the menu itself automatically everywhere.
