The AddThis Social Bookmarking Widget allows any visitor to bookmark and share your site easily with many popular services. 

== Description ==
Get more traffic back to your site! With AddThis, your users can promote your content for you by sharing to over 200 of the most popular social networking and bookmarking sites (like Facebook, Twitter, Digg, StumbleUpon and MySpace), and by emailing it to their friends. Sign up for an AddThis.com account to see how your visitors are sharing your content: which services they're using for sharing, which content is shared the most, and more. 

= WHY USE ADDTHIS? =
1. Ease of use. AddThis is easy to install, customize and localize. We've worked hard to make it the simplest, most recognized sharing tool on the internet.
2. Performance. The AddThis menu code is tiny and fast. We constantly optimize its behavior and design to make sharing a snap.
3. Peace of mind. AddThis gathers the best services on the internet so you don't have to, and backs them up with industrial strength analytics, code caching, active tech support and a thriving developer community.
4. Flexibility. AddThis can be customized via API, and served securely via SSL. You can roll your own sharing toolbars with our toolbox. Share just about anything, anywhere -- your way.
5. Global reach. AddThis sends content to more than 50 sharing services over 20 billion times a month in 20+ languages, to over half a billion unique users in countries all over the world.
6. It's free!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is AddThis free? =

Yep! The features you see today on AddThis will always be free. 

= Do I need to create an account? =

No. You only need to create an account if you want to see how your users are sharing your blog; the sharing itself works the same either way.

= Is JavaScript required? =

If you've turned on the drop-down menu (which is recommended, as it's been shown to increase sharing/bookmarking rates), JavaScript must be enabled. We load the actual interface via JavaScript at run-time, which allows us to upgrade the core functionality of the menu itself automatically everywhere.
